# Molecule Generator

Model was build and optimized on colab.research.google.com. To Make it deployable it was packed in subfiles and published on github.

This project was developed as part of a challenge in the master program "Artificial Intelligence" @ Johannes Kepler University (JKU) Linz

**Rank 3 of 100 students**

# Description
The aim of this challenge is to develop methods that can generate realistic molecules. To this end, machine learning techniques should be used that model the distribution of molecules and can generate new data.

We provide a large set of human-designed molecules as training data set from which your method can learn. The main task is to achieve a low Frechet ChemNet Distance (FCD) while auxiliary metrics "novelty", "validity" and "uniqueness" should be kept high.

Metric: Frechet ChemNet Distance (FCD)
